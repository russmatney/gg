### 24 Oct 2024

- ([`03aca7e`](https://github.com//home/russ/russmatney/gg/commit/03aca7e)) wip: pull in other shared bb.edn commands, changelog source

  > These are not genericized yet, but most are already usable in several of
  > my projects, so we're copy-pasting.


### 23 Oct 2024

- ([`a9c37ea`](https://github.com//home/russ/russmatney/gg/commit/a9c37ea)) chore: add logger and tasks
- ([`4c1fcd0`](https://github.com//home/russ/russmatney/gg/commit/4c1fcd0)) feat: call local cmd before gg cmd
- ([`ece963a`](https://github.com//home/russ/russmatney/gg/commit/ece963a)) refactor: pull babashka into src/gg

  > Feels like we want to prefer the local cmd rather than the gg one.
